**Project Title: Amazon Simulated Phishing Website**

**Description:**
This project involves the creation of a phishing website mimicking the Amazon login page, designed to collect usernames and passwords for educational purposes only. The website is specifically intended to serve as a learning tool for penetration testers, cybersecurity professionals, and ethical hackers to better understand the mechanics of phishing attacks and how malicious actors might exploit user trust. 

The website mimics the authentic Amazon login page, but instead of redirecting users to Amazon’s legitimate platform, it captures the entered credentials—username and password—and stores them in a secure manner for analysis. The tool is solely for educational use, allowing users to simulate phishing attacks in controlled environments and learn how to defend against such threats.

**Key Features:**
- **Mimicked Amazon Login Page**: The website is an exact replica of Amazon's login page to deceive potential victims into entering their credentials.
- **Credential Collection**: Captures usernames and passwords entered into the login form.
- **Educational Focus**: The tool is specifically designed for use in penetration testing and understanding phishing attacks, with no intent to harm or exploit any real users.
- **Secure Handling**: All captured credentials are stored securely and can be analyzed to demonstrate how easily sensitive information can be stolen through phishing attacks.

**Important Disclaimer:**
This project is intended exclusively for educational purposes in controlled environments. It is essential that you use this tool only with prior consent from individuals and under ethical and legal guidelines. Any malicious use of this project to collect personal data from unsuspecting users is illegal and unethical. Always adhere to legal and ethical standards in cybersecurity practices.

**Project Title: Blackeye-im - Phishing Tool Powered by Ngrok**

**Description:**
Blackeye-im is an advanced phishing tool designed to exploit ngrok and facilitate phishing attacks. It incorporates several features like port forwarding, URL shortening (using Bitly and Tinyurl APIs), and IP address-based location tracing (which includes integration with Google Maps). This tool is ideal for educational purposes, especially for penetration testing and understanding phishing mechanisms in controlled environments.

**Installation Instructions (for Linux):**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thewickedkarma/blackeye-im.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd blackeye-im
   ```
3. Grant execution permissions to the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./setup.sh
   ```
4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

**Usage:**
- For standard Linux environments:
  ```bash
  ./blackeye.sh
  ```

- For Android (Termux and equivalents):
  1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/thewickedkarma/blackeye-im.git
     ```
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd blackeye-im
     ```
  3. Grant execution permissions to the script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x ./tmxsp.sh
     ```
  4. Run the script:

**Additional Project: Amazon Vulnerability Website**
In addition to the Blackeye-im project, I have also created a simulated Amazon vulnerability website designed for penetration testing. This website is intentionally insecure to demonstrate common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and other security flaws. It is an educational tool for those looking to enhance their skills in web security testing and vulnerability assessment.
